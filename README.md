## Project Description

Welcome to the wonderful world of **automated testing**, specifically **unit testing**. Whether this is immediately clear to you or not, you have already familiarized yourselves with this process, only, the tests have been written for you beforehand.

Now we start on the other side of the fence, where you have no tests, only working code. The goal of this sprint is to get you familiar with writing unit tests for JavaScript code.

### Assignment

- Use `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies from the `package.json` file.
- type `yarn test` to start the test runner.
- open the `basic-javascript` folder and use `project-1.spec.js` to write tests for the functions inside `project-1.js`.
- use `project-2.spec.js` to write tests for the functions inside `project-2.js`.

As you write your tests, bugs in the code may be revealed, feel free to correct and _refactor_ the source code to satisfy your tests.

## Stretch Goal

Open the `advanced-javascript` folder and write tests for the `arrays.js` and `object.js` files inside the corresponding `*.spec.js` files.
